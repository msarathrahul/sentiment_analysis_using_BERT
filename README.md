# Sentiment Analysis Project README

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project! This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a collection of reviews using a pre-trained BERT model for multilingual sentiment analysis. The goal is to predict the sentiment of each review and analyze the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, which can be valuable for understanding customer opinions, product feedback, and more. In this project, we leverage the power of pre-trained language models to analyze the sentiment of various reviews.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can use the following command to install them:

   ```bash
   pip install transformers tqdm pandas numpy
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained BERT model using the Hugging Face Transformers library by running:

   ```bash
   python -c "from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment'); model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment')"
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the dataset file 'Reviews.csv' in the project directory.
2. Run the 'sentiment_analysis.py' script to analyze the sentiment of the reviews:

   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

   This script processes the reviews, predicts their sentiment using the BERT model, and generates a distribution of sentiments.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
sentiment-analysis-project/
│
├── sentiment_analysis.py     # Main script for sentiment analysis
├── Reviews.csv               # Dataset containing reviews
├── README.md                # Project README file
└── .gitignore               # Git ignore file
```

## Results

The results of the sentiment analysis are generated in terms of the distribution of sentiments within the dataset. This distribution provides insights into the overall sentiment expressed in the reviews.
